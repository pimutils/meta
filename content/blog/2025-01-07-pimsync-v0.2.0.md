I have recently [tagged a v0.2.0 release][tag] of `pimsync`. From the
[changelog][changelog]:

[tag]: https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/pimsync/refs/v0.2.0
[changelog]: https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/pimsync/tree/v0.2.0/item/CHANGELOG.md

> - Attempt to use the provided URL before doing service discovery. If the URL
>   provided in the configuration file is a valid context URL for a DAV server,
>   discovery is skipped entirely.
> - Fixed some erroneous handling of percent-encoded characters in URLs.
> - Prompt early for all required credentials. This speeds up start-up, since
>   there's no network IO between prompts.
> - Several documentation improvements.
> - Reject configuration file on superfluous parameter.

A minimal website is now available, and the documentation is now available
online too, all at <https://pimsync.whynothugo.nl/>.
