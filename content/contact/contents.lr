### GitHub issues

For development coordination and questions, please use the GitHub issue
trackers listed on the front page.

### Email

For conversations of private and *urgent* nature (such as security issues or
violations of the [CoC](/coc/)) please write to `contact@pimutils.org`.
Messages sent to this address will be forwarded to [Christian
Geier](https://github.com/geier), [Hugo Osvaldo
Barrera](https://github.com/WhyNotHugo) and [Markus
Unterwaditzer](https://github.com/untitaker/).

### IRC

While GitHub issues are our primary way to coordinate development, we also use
IRC for off-topic chatter, or when communication needs to happen in real-time.

Our channel is `#pimutils` on Freenode. Unless you have your own client
installed you can use the [Kiwi web client to join
it](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/#pimutils).

It is almost guaranteed that somebody will eventually read your message,
however depending on the time of day it may take hours for somebody to respond.
If you don't get a reply, use GitHub instead.
